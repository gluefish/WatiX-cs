##Backlog
**************************************************************************************************************************

	WatiX-cs -

		that will execute a test without my having to go into C#.  I also want this to output the results to a web
		page.
	Keywords -
		As a tester I want some keywords to be simple shortcuts to the longer C#/Webdriver commands.
	Read all tests in from Excel -
		As a tester I want the program to read all the test names to execute from Excel, then run them all.
	Web Output - started 9/11 - completed 9/20
		As a user, I want to see a web page with the information and results of every test that has been run.
		I want to put these in a unique folder along with the other results of individual tests.
	Method locations - completed 9/17
		As a programmer I want to have my methods in a logical location, with a file for each kind - like Excel 
		methods in an Excel file
